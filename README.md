# About this project

This Cinema Management System is a web application designed to help users manage movies efficiently. The homepage displays a list of movies for easy browsing and navigation. The system supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to add new movies, update existing ones, or delete them as needed.

One of the key features of the application is category management. Users can first create categories (such as genres or movie types) and then assign them when adding or editing movies. This categorization makes it easier to organize and filter movies within the system, enhancing overall usability.
